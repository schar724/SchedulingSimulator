# Scheduling Simulator

A scheduling simulator that demonstrates the first come first served, shortest job first, shortest remaining time first and
round robin scheduling algorithms. 

The UI was developed using JavaSwing. The coloured bars represent one 'clock tick' in a CPU burst.
Average waiting time, average turn around time and throughput are calculated and displayed when the 
algorithm has completed.

##Main View

The user can single step or run the algorithm in full. Individual process information is updated as the algorithm progresses.
